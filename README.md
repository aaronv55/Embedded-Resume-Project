Project Title: The Embedded Resume Project

OVERVIEW:
I just spent every free minute of the last year and half developing an embedded
system with the form factor of a cell phone to act as my resume. Everything is 
custom including a 3D-printed case, three separate PCBs, 13,000 lines of embedded C 
firmware, a product box and user manual, an entire website, and more. I made ten 
separate devices and am now boxing them up and drop shipping them to my top ten 
favorite companies as applications to their engineering teams.

Upon arrival, prospective employers can open the various apps to do things like
view my work experience and past projects, and flip through slides with pictures and audio
to hear me explain why I want to work for them in the first place.

The entire project is documented in extreme detail, including code examples and
hardware teardowns, on:

SOFTWARE NEEDED:
In order to use these drivers, simply install either KeiluVision IDE or STM32CubeIDE
and start a new project for the STM32F410R8T6 microcontroller.




HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT:
This GitHub repository is admittedly more of me giving potential employers an example
of my coding skillset. I decided to open it up for anyone developing on the STM32F410R8T6,
since there are lots of helpful drivers for things like SPI, RTC, DAC, ADC, Timers, UART 
and more. In order to use any of this code, you will need to download either KeiluVision
or STM32CubeIDE, both of which will automatically generate the needed dependency files after
starting a new project for the STM32F410R8T6.

MORE DETAILS COMING SOONâ€¦




UPDATES COMING SOON:
The initial project release has this bare bones README file, but I will be updating
it with more detailed instructions in the near future. Please check back soon.
